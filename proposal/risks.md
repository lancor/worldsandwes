## Risks
As a university sponsored project, all research activity funded by this grant will require approval from the SCSU  Institutional Review Board and any consent and assent from participants.

### Humane Tech Isn't Engineered
Mindsets do not shift easily. Many developers look to engineer their way to the perfect social solution. As Sara Wachter-Boettcher (2017) points out, this world belief that "Code can save the world, but only I can write it" traces its roots, back to bias engineered into computer science since the 1950's when psychologists identified loner men as the most apt for programming and then built assessments to identify these types of employees. Yet subtle concepts of bias of perfection, impostor syndrome to explicit bias around competition, verbal discourse, and neurodiversity have weeded their way through all of our history (Banaji & Greenwald, 2017).

We cannot code our way to better community. While what we engineer reflects our bias, engineering alone can never overcome perspectives and pasts. Instead we must carve anew; placing our principles before our pull requests. To overcome the risk of settled mindsets, we will first put a focus on listening to voices who tech does not serve or has not served safely.
We will then root the story of ethics in computer science into the narratives of at-risk populations. We will study the shape of the story and come to understand how the prescriptive technologies (Ursula, 2004) control the shape of stories we tell. We will then create narratives through our proposed WebVR case studies.

This does introduce the risk of too many possibilities. Amy Burvall notes that constraints lead to greater creativity. We will mitigate this risk by first focusing on creating WebVR content using A-Frame technologies as a proof of concept before scaling up to a full virtual reality recording studio.

However, we will provide everyone with a domain of their own and a blog to ensure they own their stories.

### Interdisciplinary Approach
Our use of WebVR and A-Frame will require computer science engineers to study digital storytelling and narratology while English and education majors study computer science. The populations served by many community colleges and state universities in the United States have multiple jobs and families to raise. Adding additional domains of knowledge to already crowded curriculum can add stress to the lives of students.

To mitigate these risks, we will add additional scaffolds, a network of open participants, bi-monthly face to face meetings, and on-demand video tutorials.  We will also stress the importance of community in Open Pedagogy and encourage participants to rely on each other and the knowledge we create and curate together.

### Open and Privacy
Online communication, such as tweets, blog posts, and comments are generally out in the open and technically “public” and available for researchers to analyze and quote. Internet researchers have, however, documented how a particular communication may be technically public but viewed by the individual who posted it as meant for a more limited or private context.

Even if individuals feel that they have “published” in public or have consented to be part of research, they might still feel like trust has been violated if their words are taken up and re-framed in a way that they feel is out of context or misrepresented. While this study will seek IRB approval, we also have stringent rules around user sat:

*	We will analyze and publish data that is de-identified or aggregated in ways that cannot be traced back to an individual.
*	Any identifiable quotes or descriptions of activities will not be used in a research publication or presentation without the permission of the individual. This includes anonymized or pseudonymized quotes, because they can be linked back through a search engine to an individual public posting.

Participants may also be contacted and recruited to participate in surveys and interviews for specific research studies. In these cases, we will offer a clear explanation of the consent and privacy procedures, how the data will be used, and what benefit the research will provide to the individual and the community. We will also allow interviewees the opportunity to review transcripts and quotes.

No student will be required to join the study. In fact, someone beside the class instructor will collect permissions and the teaching professor will not know who agreed to be included until grades are submitted.

Participants may be asked to complete an additional consent form which will have been reviewed and approved by our Institutional Review Board.
